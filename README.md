Mask Detection using YOLOv8

Detecting and classifying face mask usage using the YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) object detection model.

Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build an automatic object detection system to detect human faces and classify mask-wearing status into two classes:

with_mask – Wearing a mask correctly

without_mask – Not wearing a mask

Real-world applications:
Healthcare safety monitoring, public surveillance systems, and mobile applications for mask compliance checking.
